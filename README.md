# Ruby on Rails Learning
- First started a crash course to learn Ruby Programming Language from [here](https://www.classcentral.com/classroom/freecodecamp-ruby-programming-language-full-course-58000/61875760c0ada) or from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_ispmWmdjY).
- My repo of [Learning Ruby Language](https://github.com/RifatArefin32/learn-ruby-free-code-camp). Can see through it as a short note.
- Getting started with rails from [here](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)
